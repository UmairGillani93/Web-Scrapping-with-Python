# Web-Scrapping-with-Python

This repository contains Python scripts based on Scrapping different websites. Mostly the Scrapping tool I have used is Python bs4 library. We'll use Scrapy frame work as well to show you how to scrape the dynamic websites as well! Go ahead and feel free to copy the code for the educational purpose. Thanks
