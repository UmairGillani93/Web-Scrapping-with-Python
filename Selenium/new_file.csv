UN-Habitat prioritizes resilience and good practices that reduce vulnerabilities and risks before and after disasters.
UN-Habitat provides a cross-cutting approach for reducing vulnerabilities and risks before and after the disasters. The organization’s approach to disaster risk management/disaster risk reduction, reconstruction and recovery is based on its long-standing experience in working closely with the communities, provincial and local authorities to meet their needs for land, shelter, basic services, secure tenure and infrastructure while simultaneously addressing the longer-term development needs and suggesting advocating on policy interventions guidelines.
