4.0 out of 5 stars,"I was replacing an older modem separate router setup max speed measured was 150Mbps at 5G and 72Mbps at 2.4 G.We have Time Warner / Spectrum service.  I made the connections according to the instructions for setup for the new Arris Surfboard by Ethernet cable but I wasn't able to connect to the internet.  I called tech support for Arris and was on hold for 75 minutes.  They told me that I have to contact my service ( TW / Spec ) and activate the modem first, then call them for help.  The instructions that came with the modem did not say that in the setup instructions at all.  Even the guy on the phone said "" Yeah, we missed that part""  Called TW / Spect next on hold again....you know how that feels...recorded message..Your call is important to us, please stay on the line....etc...finally got thru and they sent the activate signal for the new Arris to workThat was the bad part......BOOOOO....cost Arris a starGood part now....Setup using the ethernet cable connection to a laptop Win 7 got into the menu using 192.168.0.1default login is  admin  PW  password and was able to continue the setup from there for 2.4 and 5 G home networksI down loaded an app  Wifi Analytics from Netgear ( free) and was able to measure Wireless signal strength all over the house and patio.  MUCH MUCH better with before and after tests  Example..  5G on patio was 6 Mbps before, now 117Mbps with Arris.  All signals throughout the house much better and stronger, connections speeds at 5G much better depending on the room ( distance ) and walls in the way speeds are 390 Mbps to 865 Mbps nowThe Netgear app has a house measure feature with allows you to go room to room and measure signals and speeds so you can map your house and place the Arris in the best spot for results.Hint for setup...download to your cell or tablet an app that lets you measure signals and speed for Wifi, this will really help you and measure your signals before you make a change so you know how much improvement you get...or not...Next...after you connect your Arris Surfboard to your service provider call them and have them send the activate signal so you can get started on the rest of the setup.  After setup is finished and working...go back and remeasure all the signals in the same spot as before you started...so you can see the difference

4.0 out of 5 stars,"Did speedtest's using the same server point on both 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz before swapping from the Xfinity provided unit to this new Arris and the results were nearly identical. About 179Mbps download and 11.4Mbps upload on 5Ghz for both on Blast+ 150Mbps service. With the 2.4Ghz though... with 3 tests of 2.4Ghz on the stock unit I hit about 58.2Mbps download and 10.8Mbps upload each time, and on the Arris I hit 57 download the first test and the next two were about 110!  Could be a fluke with variables on the test server etc, but the 2.4Ghz seems to be better on the Arris! Love that this is a matte finish plastic all around though compared to the Xfinity. So no fingerprints and less noticeable dust!CONS: Only issue I've noticed after a couple weeks of use is that the downward antenna range on this is near non existent compared to the stock xfinity modem.  I live in a 1050 sqft dublex style 2 story and with the Arris in the top left room (2nd floor) I now have only 1 bar/no wifi in the kitchen (bottom right, 1st floor).  I have not tried the opposite setup with the Arris on the ground floor to see if the upward antenna range is better, but If range is important for you, or you have a 2 story I suggest trying this on the ground floor or going with a different unit.UPDATE: In a new 660sqft ground level apt. im losing signal in the next room only 10 steps down the hall from the bedroom.  Also, weaker signal just through one wall into my living room. Definitely not suitable for a large house. I hope they fix this with FW in the future.  When youre close its amazing, but walk away and you can watch the signal start dropping bars-also these LED's are BRIGHT! I put black paper tape over the front LEDs which worked well for the indicators, but the open vent holes on the top of the unit allow for a lot of blue light spill, basically a blue tennis racket like pattern projected on your wall. So be prepared to have to find some entertainment center cabinet to cover this with etc.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Have had this for several months so I figured it was a good enough time to use it and review it.Set up as usual was easy.Plug it in and call the internet company, Cox in my case.After a few minutes of telling them some information about the unit and waiting for blinking lights, internet was back on!Our last modem/router was also “ac” but wasn’t nearly as fast or could handle as many devices.We have a smart tv, 2 iPhones, 2 iPads, a MacBook Pro, plus devices from family and friends that come over.Not a ton of devices, but the upgrade definitely helped.Before if someone was watching Netflix, the internet would slow to a crawl for everyone else.Not anymore!A nice bonus was our download speed is higher than the rated average we pay for.The USB plus is amazing as well, I have my hard drive plugged in and can access information from it on our devices and even smart tv.Still trying to figure out port forwarding and all that so I can access it away from home, maybe some day...

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought my 1st Comcast Modem/Router to stop paying the monthly rental charge. That was over 5 years ago. It cost $199 and at $10/month rental charge, it paid for itself in 20 months so it was all gravy after that.  I bough this new modem/router to improve my wireless connections. The performance is very good and easy to set up. I'd buy it again or recommend it to a friend.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"Like many others, I was not enthralled with the idea of paying $12/mo to rent a modem when I can purchase one and break even in under one year. My first customer-owned model was a Netgear - but, it failed, and so my search for a new modem/router combo began. I settled on this specific model for several reasons: First and foremost, it had the best customer ratings. Second, it offered better Wi-Fi coverage. Third, it is 24x8, meaning, this will still work if I upgrade to gigabit internet in the future. All told, the WiFi signal is acceptable - not quite as good as the Netgear; but, it works reliably, whereas the Netgear did not.As far as the web interface, I found the router settings easy to work with (but I'm quite seasoned with this stuff). It does run a little slow at times; but, no complaints. It is easy to navigate through, and offers several customization features to satisfy all users, beginners to experts.

2.0 out of 5 stars,"Ethernet works.  That helps.  Wi-Fi works.  Whew. That's good.  Wish there was a user friendly app to control Wi-Fi access for all connected devices.  It saves me from paying  $11/month to cable company for modem lease fee. The software that is supposed to help parents monitor internet usage is daunting to set up and use.  Arris has McAfee Secure Home Internet and you are supposed to be able to download the app on your phone and be able to see devices connected on your wifi.  I could not see any connected device.  Forget about ARRIS tech suppport. They told me to go on Web Manager.  I did.  I can't access my modem settings.  They told me to do a factory reset.  I did that.  I try again.  I still can't log into Web Manager or McAfee SHI.  I went on ARRIS chat again and they tell me to do another factory reset, power cycle my modem, and power cycle my computer.  After all of the steps followed, I still cannot go on Web Manager or McAfee SHI.  If you want a modem that has similar parental control capabilities as a modem leased through a cable company look at a different brand besides ARRIS such as Net Gear.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"blazing fast and excellent WIFI performance.  This was a bear to get setup otherwise would have given it 5 stars.  The correct MAC address was not clearly defined and I gave the wrong MAC to the cable provider which required a service tech to come out and with his up-line support to fix the issue. As a consumer, I couldn't reach this level of support. The level of support available to me could not get this resolved.  Otherwise a great product.  New firmware has IOS or Android parental controls available for use with this gateway.

We have a smart home with a lot of devices including Amazon Alexa devices in just about every room and I have to say everything works perfectly.I pay for 60 mbps internet and I was lucky to get 10 to 20 mbps wifi with our old netgear unit. This Arris unit gives me 60 to 70 mbps on wifi!! HUGE difference in overall performance!Finally, It's so nice not to think about our internet anymore, or having to reboot our router every few days.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"With regards to the modem and router itself I couldn't be happier. Easy install and excellent speeds. Much faster than Comcast's modem. However, if you are buying this to replace a Comcast Xfinity modem be aware that if you signed up for the ""Triple Play"" bundle from them that includes TV, internet, and phone service because it was cheaper than bundles without the phone (inexplicably) they will not allow you to return their modem and have the modem rental fee taken off your bill because this Arris modem does not support phone. Even if you never hooked up or used a phone with their modem. Since it is typically a 1 or 2 year contract you sign with them you have to wait until that contract is up before you can rework your plan to not include phone service and then you can return their modem and have the rental fee removed.Arris makes another modem that does support phone from Comcast but it is considerably more expensive.

1.0 out of 5 stars,"This was my 2nd and LAST Arris combo router/modem thing. They are just bad choices, (in my case). I returned this particular item after owning it for about 3 weeks. It replaced a 1-1/2 year old Arris SBG6782 AC. Turns out both were dropping signal and powering off on a daily basis.  This new Arris SBG7400AC2  was junk right out of the box. So much so, that I had 2 service calls with COX cable, thinking it was trouble on their end. After replacing the cable from street to home and from box on home to interior, resulting in no fix of the signal drop, I returned the Arris.It WAS the problem.  So now I’ve gotten smart, I replaced with an Arris modem (SB6183) and a Linksys  AC 2200 Tri Band WiFi router.Since Oct 7 2019, I’ve experienced NO signal drop or powering off of the new configuration.DON’T BUY Cable modem/WiFi Router combo unit from Arris. The “idea” is great, but they need developers that can actually make one that works before going public.

My cable company was great to work with, but Arris' tech support was not.  All they wanted to do was point a finger at my cable company.  Finally Arris' 2nd tier support admitted it was the cable modem that was bad.  Amazon shipped a new one right away, and it is working great!  Set up was easy, WiFi signal is strong throughout my 2000 sf home and the speed is exactly the speed I'm paying for from my cable company.  I have my many devices split approximately evenly between the 2.4 and 5 ghz bands and everything works as it should.  I have guest networks set up so that I don't have to share my primary passwords with guests and I have had no complaints there either.

After researching online, i saw this was recommended and loved the price. It came promptly (as always, thanks amazon) and was super easy to install (Comcast provider).Loved that tech support was MORE than willing, it had warranties and security with customization options easily accessible (up the yin yang).However, the passwords had a hard time syncing across devices (one tv took a good HOUR or re-inputting. Others were no problem) which was strange. Most importantly, my issue was that the network was far too glitchy for what i need/ was expecting so i had to return.

This is a major pain as I have a highly connected home and every single device has to be repaired every time. On average I’ve spent about 5h per week getting it back up and running. This is despite contacting both my service provider (Cox) and Arris support on a regular basis. Finally tonight (after Arris support closed for the day so I couldn’t even get assistance) I had enough and decided to return it, only to find that the return window closed 2 days ago. So I’m out the cost of an expensive modem which is practically unusable.

Sure, speed will fluctuate but reaching more than 150mb is fantastic. If I want to upgrade my internet's speed, say double or triple the speed, this model will allow it. Before switching to your old modem, be prepared when calling Xfinity with the modem/router model number and MAC address for activation. The switch was a breeze and I was surfing in no time. At home we have one Windows 10 laptop, two laptops with Linux, 3 Android phones, a smart tv, and an iPad. I have seen some negative reviews and they seem to be stupid. It will NOT work if it is not on your cable/internet provider. Call your cable/internet provider with the model number to be safe before purchasing. I saw other negative reviews but will keep them to myself or they will get blasted by me. LOL!!!See screenshot of 176mb when my plan is 150mb. Not too shabby at all...

5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a network engineer. So, my life is routing. This router is FAST, but theoretical speed is nothing if the router cannot handle it. After all, your network is only as fast as the slowest device. So, having a high amount of download bandwidth from your ISP is useless if your equipment cannot support it (bandwidth vs throughput). This device is capable of 1Gbps, and most of us only have an internet speed of < 100Mbps. This is from the ISP to the device. Once inside your home, the wifi supports speeds of 2340 Mbps or 2Gbps. and the ethernet port of 1Gbps. Basically, it is overkill. That, however, means little if you are connecting more devices than you have available download channels. There are 24 download and 8 upload. We currently have 3 wifi TVs, 4 PCs, 2 tablets, and 4 phones in my house, and we have no issues with buffering on my 100Mbps connection from Xfinity.The wifi route uses 802.11ac2 which provides the faster speeds I mentioned before but also uses beamforming. That means the signal focuses on connected devices with a stronger signal instead of just pushing equal strength into unused areas of your home. AC also supports both 2.4GHz and 5Ghz. 2.4 has a lower wave and travels further, at the expense of some speed, and 5 has a high wave with faster speed, at the expense of distance. 802.11ac2 will work the same on any router you get (in theory).If I had to nit-pick something, it would be the web interface. It can be slow at times, but you really only need to use it on the initial setup.

MY work VPN connection getting dropped and reconnects every few minutes - which worked flawlessly with 4 year old router.

Other major issue is static DNS reservations for my printer and SmartThings gateway are getting lost every time router restarted - which happens frequently.On the positive side, Wifi AC seemed very fast for internal file transfers (peaked @ 800Mbps in bandwidth tests, average 400+ Mbps)The Surfboard customer support was not helpful and quick to blame Comcast/Xfinity for the internet issues and unstable connections.This one is going back and I am stuck with paying for the return shipping - I wish I had brought it on Amazon.
